# bedtime-routine-designer

### Overview

My project will provide a few pre-made bed time routines geared towards children and also allow the parents to create a custom routine for their children using provided tasks and custom tasks they can add themselves. It will also include a duration for each activity and allow a parent to choose a bed time and automatically compute what time the user should start the bed time and a start and ending time for each activity in the routine. Additionally, I would like my app to give the parent the option to create a pdf version of the routine so it can be printed and allow children of certain ages to know what activities to do for their bedtime routine and promote independence. 
I had the idea to design this app from personal experiences. I struggle to keep my 3 children on any sort of bedtime routine. Having an app like this would help tremendously since I can quickly and easily create and keep track of the routine, teach my older children how to adhere to their routine or maybe even let them design a routine themselves. This also makes it easy to communicate their bedtime routine and the time of night it should take place to all caregivers. I have a very supportive family which is helpful but makes communication very tricky.  
Parents will find this app useful because it will allow them to either quickly implement a pre-made routine or they can create a routine that suits their family’s needs and implement the routine in their daily lives.  
Additionally, I could make several other similar apps such as a bedtime routine geared towards adults and a morning routine geared toward children.
